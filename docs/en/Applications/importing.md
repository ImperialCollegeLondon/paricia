# Formatting

## Importing

Importing data into the database is the fundamental action that many users will want to carry. While the model that drives the process is simple, as shown below, it depends on many others described in other sections and therefore inconsistencies in the choices - eg. a data format that is not compatible with the data file - will cause the process to fail.

A how-to guide on how to submit data to Paricia can be found in the [Importing Data](../importing_data.md) section.
