# Introduction

This guide will help users of Paricia to get up to speed with its functionality and start making use of its features.

There are two types of Paricia users, those who are interested in exploring the data available - either registered users or not - and those who manage stations and want to create new entries in the database. The first group can just check the [Reporting](./reports.md) documentation, as it contains all the information they will need. The others should become familiar with all the pages of this user guide.

It should not be necessary to check the Developers documentation, but it might be helpful, occasionally, to have a look at the [Contributing guidelines](./contributing.md) if you spot something that does not work as expected and you want to report it, and at the [Applications page](./Applications/index.md) where there are mode detailed descriptions of the models that make up Paricia.
